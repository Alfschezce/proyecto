<p>	I am a pencil born as tall and slim.
Wrapped in plane or stripped apparels,
I begin my life <span>w</span>ith a sharp edge and thrills.
They hold me and I work,
They put me down and I rest.
I don't know why i walk miles
on those white <span>a</span>nd straight pages,
but I feel happy to fill their lank spaces.
